This repository is only for a problem within MAUI (specifically .NET 7). It concerns the selection of items within a `CollectionView`, whereby the color of an item does not remain permanent if you have selected an item. In .NET 6 this worked. This repository is based on the following [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/controls/collectionview/selection?view=net-maui-7.0).
